I'm from Mchenry Illinois, which is about 30 minutes south of the Wisconsin border. I worked
at a grocery store throughout high school and got my first internship over this past summer
at Continental Automotives. I watch a lot of hulu in my free time, but also do a decent
amount of volunteering around Chicago.

I want to get a better understanding of the Fundamentals of Web Design from this class. There
are some things I want to understand better, like when and why to use certain fonts, certain
html tags, and better styling techniques in css. I see this bettering my ability to use the
building block of web design.

I'm a fourth year in ITM at IIT, actually studying Web Development. I've always enjoyed the kind
of work that comes with web development and that it comes with many different ways to succeed. You
can solve a problem in multiple ways and you can make a design that you came up with. It allows for
a lot of freedom in the work, which is something I enjoy when working on web dev projects and just
working on websites for fun.
